# 🗑️ SmartBin - CAD Modeling

This repository contains the CAD modeling of the **SmartBin (Intelligent Trash Bin)**.  
It includes the original Autodesk Inventor files, as well as exported versions for general use and 3D printing.

## 📂 File Structure

- **/Assembly** → Full assembly in Autodesk Inventor and STEP formats (.iam, .ipt, .step)  
- **/Parts-Inventor** → Individual parts in Autodesk Inventor (.ipt)  
- **/Parts-STEP** → Individual parts exported in neutral STEP format (.step)  
- **/Parts-STL** → Files prepared for 3D printing (.stl)  

## 📌 Notes
- Project modeled in **Autodesk Inventor**.  
- **STEP** and **STL** files were generated to ensure compatibility with different CAD software and 3D printers.  
- Subfolder organization makes it easier to access each type of file.
